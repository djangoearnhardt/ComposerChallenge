# ComposerChallenge

There are two branches created, which correspond to two issues (Issues tab in GitHub) representing the challenges. 

The first is to create a cell view programmatically. The second is to create a protocol to handle button tapping from each UITableViewCell.

Solve each challenge on its corresponding branch, and make a pull request into `release`. I'll review the PR's and we'll discuss your approach.
